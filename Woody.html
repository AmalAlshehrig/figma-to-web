    leader of the toys in Andy's room. However, his position is <br>
    jeopardized by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut <br>
    action figure that Andy got as a birthday present. Buzz is <br>
    convinced that he is an actual Space Ranger instead of a toy. <br>

    in hopes of retaining his status as Andy's favorite toy; Buzz  <br>
    instead falls out an open window and the other toys accuse <br>
